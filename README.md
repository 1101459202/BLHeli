This tree contains the BLHeli assembly code for sensorless brushless motor electronic speed control (ESC) boards.
It was initially designed for use with Eflite mCP X, but is well suited for other copters/planes.

There is one version of the software for Silabs MCU based ESCs, and another for Atmel MCU based ESCs.
Both versions are now at the same revision.
